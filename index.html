    This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogenous 
    classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared 
    to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. 
    We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive 
    active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

    Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent machine through 
    the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active 
    system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, ie., 
    their potential to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Committee 
    (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space 
    reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each 
    epoch they are presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class labels. After adding 
    the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve 
    an efficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, 
    such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to 
    drop, as in Vlachos (2008).
