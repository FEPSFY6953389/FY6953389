  <p class="ex1">
  <p>
    Pharmaceutical manufacturing has traditionally relied on batch production, where drugs are made in a series of sequential steps. While
    this method is effective, it often leads to high energy usage and excessive chemical waste, making it less sustainable and efficient. 
    This article aims to look at the shift towards continuous manufacturing, comparing it with batch processes to explore its potential for 
    more sustainable pharma production. Chemical engineering plays a vital role in allowing this transition by designing and optimising the 
    technologies that support continuous pharma production. The findings show that, unlike batch production, continuous manufacturing uses 
    less energy and generates less waste. In short, transitioning from batch to continuous offers a greener way to produce medicines. 
    Adopting this approach can help the pharmaceutical industry meet growing demands while reducing environmental impact, aligning with 
    modern sustainability goals.

  <h3 id="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Introduction_InText">
    For years, batch manufacturing (Altabrisa Group Limited, LLC, 2024) has been strongly relied on by the pharmaceutical industry, producing 
    drugs in a step-by-step procedure. While batch manufacturing has been carried out for its advantages of equipment flexibility and being 
    well-established, this technique has led to significant chemical waste and low operational performance, which resulted in a shortage of 
    medicines (Diab et al., 2018; Lee et al.,2015). <br><br>

    Over the past two decades (Kashinath et al., 2025), the industry has begun shifting towards continuous manufacturing in both research and 
    production (NNIT, no date). Instead of executing the process in discrete batches, raw materials flow smoothly through chemical formulations, 
    producing a steady stream of drugs. This approach not only reduces production time and manufacturing costs but also enhances efficiency and 
    improves quality control (Taylor, 2024), thereby making drug production more sustainable.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Difference Between Batch and Continuous Manufacturing"><b>Difference Between Batch and Continuous Manufacturing</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Analysis1_InText">
    In traditional batch manufacturing, drugs are produced with individual steps and pauses between them. Each batch must be set up, processed, 
    and then cleaned down before processing the next batch, which makes the overall process time-consuming and energy-intensive. Minor variations 
    during production can also lead to inconsistent quality, sometimes needing the entire batch to be discarded (Lee et al., 2015). Additionally, 
    more chemical waste is often generated since each batch relies on multiple discrete stages. <br><br>

    On the other hand, continuous manufacturing keeps raw materials flowing continuously through chemical reactions and formulations without any 
    interference to the process (Aranda-Hernandez, 2025, p. 831). This method enables real-time monitoring and control over conditions, such as 
    temperature and pressure, thus enhancing product quality (Taylor, 2024). Moreover, continuous processes consume less energy and fewer raw 
    materials, significantly reducing the amount of waste produced (General Kinematics, 2017). In short, continuous manufacturing represents a 
    major advancement in efficiency and sustainability in the pharma industry.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Why Continuous Manufacturing is Considered More Sustainable"><b>Why Continuous Manufacturing is Considered More Sustainable</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Analysis2_InText">
    According to UK CPI, "when compared with the automotive sector, greenhouse-gas emissions from the pharmaceutical industry are 55% higher per 
    dollar of revenue - 48.55 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per million dollars in pharma, compared to 31.4 tonnes in automotive." 
    (Berry, 2023; Belkhir, 2019). This statistic emphasises how much more carbon-intensive the pharma industry is relative to other sectors, 
    which adds urgency to the need for greener production alternatives like continuous manufacturing. <br><br>

    Continuous systems are more energy-efficient, since they operate in a seamless flow without the need to repeat the manufacturing steps 
    typically used in a classic batch process. This method requires compact equipment, such as continuous reactors and automated control 
    systems (Grahm, 2024), which reduces energy consumption and, therefore, carbon footprint. <br><br>

    Furthermore, this will ensure that the quality of the produced drugs is consistent, which ultimately leads to fewer batches being discarded 
    and waste being noticeably reduced (Lee et al., 2015). All things considered, these factors make continuous manufacturing a route towards 
    more efficient and sustainable pharma production.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Challenges of Adopting Continuous Manufacturing"><b>Challenges of Adopting Continuous Manufacturing</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Analysis3_InText">
    Despite its advantages, the idea of using continuous manufacturing still faces certain challenges. Many pharmaceutical plants already have 
    batch equipment fixed in place, so rebuilding a continuous manufacturing line can be expensive and time-consuming. Another barrier includes 
    regulatory uncertainties between health authorities. According to Lawrence De Belder, executive consultant at Pharmatech Associates, a USP 
    company, "Many health authorities are very supportive of CM (continuous manufacturing), but many do not have much experience, and their 
    requirements are not always clear." (Markarian, 2022). In addition to this, continuous manufacturing relies on advanced automation systems, 
    which require specialist training for technicians or engineers to operate safely and effectively.
  </p>

  <h3 id="A Chemical Engineer's Perspective"><b>A Chemical Engineer's Perspective</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Analysis4_InText">
    Chemical Engineers play a crucial role in the development and optimisation of continuous manufacturing systems. Their expertise in reaction 
    engineering and process control ensures that equipment operates efficiently, meeting the growing demands of pharma production 
    (UPES Editorial Team, 2025). This would then involve amplifying chemical reactions to suit a larger-scale production, determining which 
    equipment is suitable for the process, and ensuring that the production meets standard regulatory requirements (Clifton, 2025). <br><br>

    Unlike batch processes, continuous manufacturing requires a thorough understanding of how chemical reactions act under certain conditions, 
    such as temperature and pressure, where they must remain steady over time. Thus, maintaining these optical conditions is vital for ensuring 
    that the reactions occur efficiently with minimal waste generation. <br><br>

    </figure><br><br>

    Additionally, the incorportation of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) enables real-time monitoring and control of pharma production processes. 
    Through tools such as near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), any changes that may occur can then 
    be detected immediately to reduce the likelihood of inconsistencies in product quality (Grahm, 2024). <br><br>

    Essentially, chemical engineers bridge the gap between large-scale production and laboratory innovation. Their ability to link scientific 
    understanding with practical process design ensures that continuous manufacturing remains a reliable method for drug production that meets both 
    the global growing demands and modern sustainable goals.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <p id="Conclusion_InText">
    The comparison between batch manufacturing and continuous manufacturing clearly illustrates that continuous processes are more efficient and 
    sustainable. By minimising waste generation and conserving energy, continuous manufacturing represents a more efficient and greener way to 
    produce a continuous supply of high-quality drugs (Lee et al., 2015). Furthermore, continuous systems support improved process and quality 
    control, allowing manufacturers to maintain consistency in quality throughout the whole production. This has helped greatly reduce product 
    variability and produce safer, more dependable pharmaceutical supply chains. As global demand continues to rise, the benefits of continuous 
    manufacturing become important for long-term environmental responsibilty and the growth of the industry. Thus, adopting this method enables the 
    pharmaceutical industry to meet growing demand for medicines while minimising environmental impact.
